there are mission-critical workloads.",When dedicated capacity is need, When an instance should not be stopped. ," A  The key to understanding spot instances is to look at the way that cloud 
service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate. Cloud service 
providers invest in hardware resources and then release those resources 
(often on a per-hour basis) to subscribers. One of the problems with this 
business model, however, is that at any given time, there are likely to be 
compute resources that are not being utilized. These resources represent 
hardware capacity that AWS has paid for but are sitting idle, and not 
making AWS any money at the moment.Rather than allowing these computing 
resources to go to waste, AWS offers them at a substantially discounted 
rate, with the understanding that if someone needs those resources for 
running a normal EC2 instance, that instance will take priority over spot 
instances that are using the hardware resources at a discounted rate.In 
fact, spot instances will be stopped if the resources are needed 
elsewhere."

based on the number of requests and consumed compute resources. "," D  AWS Lambda is charging its users by the number of requests for their 
functions and by the duration, which is the time the code needs to execute. 
When code starts running in response to an event, AWS Lambda counts a 
request. It will charge the total number of requests across all of the 
functions used. Duration is calculated by the time when your code started 
executing until it returns or until it is terminated, rounded up near to 
100ms. The AWS Lambda pricing depends on the amount of memory that the user

that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and 
computers over the internet.AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can 
use the default security group and still customize it according to your 
liking (although we donג€™t recommend this practice because groups should

time-consuming.✑ Pilot Light: This method keeps critical applications and 
data at the ready so that it can be quickly retrieved if needed.✑ Warm 
Standby: This method keeps a duplicate version of your businessג€™ core 
elements running on standby at all times, which makes for a little downtime 
and an almost seamless transition.✑ Multi-Site Solution: Also known as a 
Hot Standby, this method fully replicates your companyג€™s 
data/applications between two or more active locations and splits your 
traffic/usage between them. If a disaster strikes, everything is simply 
rerouted to the unaffected area, which means youג€™ll suffer almost zero

Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously 
replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone 
(AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent 
infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an 
infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the 
standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you 
can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since 
the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your 
application can resume database operation without the need for manual 
administrative 
intervention."

various components to interact with each other only through specific, 
technology- agnostic interfaces. Modifying any underlying operations 
without affecting other components should be made 
possible."
